# Project C variable, if, else, while

## Learning Objectives

Welcome to the "Low Level Programming - Part 2" project! In this part, you'll continue to enhance your understanding of fundamental concepts in C programming. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

### General

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Understand and use arithmetic operators in C.
2. **Logical Operators**: Comprehend boolean operators and their usage.
3. **Relational Operators**: Learn about relational operators and how to use them.
4. **TRUE and FALSE Values**: Identify values considered TRUE and FALSE in C.
5. **Boolean Operators**: Understand and use boolean operators.
6. **Conditional Statements**: Use the `if` and `if...else` statements effectively.
7. **Comments**: Learn how to use comments in C.
8. **Variable Declaration**: Declare variables of types `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`.
9. **Variable Assignment**: Assign values to variables.
10. **Printing Variables**: Print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int` using `printf`.
11. **While Loop**: Understand and use the `while` loop.
12. **ASCII Character Set**: Familiarize yourself with the ASCII character set.
13. **GCC Flags**: Understand the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`.

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. The source code is provided. Your task is to complete it to print whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit

Similar to the previous task, this program assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints the last digit of that number along with specific conditions.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.

### 3. alphABET

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by the alphabet in uppercase, using only the `putchar` function.

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using only the `putchar` function.

### 5. Numbers

Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10, using only the `putchar` function.

### 6. Numberz

Similar to the previous task, print all single-digit numbers in base 10, but with additional restrictions on variable types and function usage.

### 7. Smile in the mirror

Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using only the `putchar` function.

### 8. Hexadecimal

Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, adhering to specific formatting rules, using only the `putchar` function.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and enjoy the process of mastering these fundamental concepts in C programming!
